# Kids Dev Studio - Beta

The extension that makes coding fun and easy to learn with the full power of Visual Studio Code!

## For Teachers and Instructors

This extension for Visual Studio Code simplifies the user interface and serves as a better transition for children learning to code from other platforms or languages like Small Basic to programming in industry standard languages!

Friendly UI: focuses on the main items young students need for working with their code. The UI still remains flexible for students to add other feature options - so no age limits! They can still run and debug their code normally.

Library feature: import your study plan to the library to allow students to explore details of specific classes and methods!
Just import a class file to have the documentation showing in the library pane. They'll also be able to copy methods their code.

Friendly Intellisense: students get more explanations and details as they complete their code! 

## For Students
